# Game Time Master
Sick of memorising time zones to convert for games and their daily reset times?  
Then this is for you!

## Features
- Automatically detects your local time zone.
- Converts all game server times to your local time zone.
- Shows the time remaining until a game server's daily reset.
- Automatically refreshes times every minute.
	- Option to refresh and display every second.
- All calculations take daylight savings into account where applicable.
	- By default, this assumes that servers keep the same times (e.g. 06:00 PST -> 06:00 PDT).  
	If a game doesn't (e.g. 05:00 PST -> 06:00 PDT), then it will be adjusted for that game.
- Choose between 24-hour and 12-hour time formats.
- Search for specific games.
- Filter specific games and save this setting per browser.
- Dark/night mode, which is automatically enabled based on system preferences.

Feel free to request for more games to be added by creating an issue [here](https://github.com/cicerakes/Game-Time-Master/issues), or by filling out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0T_8Smk0vnp-VtR3eJSnSu3uLa3nFlWbCq9-jMqujmU1qcA/viewform).

## Feature Roadmap
- Manually set time zone (for when auto detect is wrong).
- Add custom game servers.

### Adding Game Servers
#### Summary:
- Add game server details to `game-data.js`.
- Add game icon to `game-icons` folder.

See below for more in-depth details.

---

Required data when adding a game: 
- Game name
	- If the game did not initially release in an English speaking region: 
		- Prioritise using its official English translation name when available, otherwise  
		- Use the official translation for its other franchise media (e.g. if an anime exists for it with an official English translation), otherwise  
		- Use a romanised version of the name.  
		Example: `赤いリンゴ` -> `Akai Ringo`.
- Game server region or language
	- If a game's region/language is further split into multiple servers with multiple timezones, these are added as seperate servers.
	- Some examples:
		- A `Global` game with multiple servers such as `Americas`, `Asia`, and `Europe`.
		- A `Global` game with just one server.
		- A game with servers in `English` and `Japanese`.
- Game server timezone
	- This can be a region/language or offset. 
	- You will need to find it in the tz database.  
		- You can use [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
			- Ensure its `Type` is `Canonical`, and if not, find what it links to which should be `Canonical`.
			- You will want to use what is in the `TZ database name` column.
			- Note that if using an offset, it will be inverted.
				- Example: `UTC+6` or `GMT+6` will have a `TZ database name` of `Etc/GMT-6`.
- Game server daily reset time
	- Ensure this is the daily reset time for the **server's** timezone.
	- This is usually the time when a player receives (daily) login rewards.
	- If a game has multiple reset times, prioritise what is used for login rewards. 
	- If no login reward system exists, use the time that the majority of content resets.
- Game icon
	- This can be taken from an official source such as the Google Play store.
	- Resize this to 90x90 pixels.
		- If the original icon is not a square, avoid stretching the image and instead add empty padding as needed.
	- GIF file format.
	- Kebab case filename.  
	Example: `game-name.gif`.
	- If an icon already exists for the game in a different region/language, but looks different, simply append the region/language to the filename.  
	Examples: `game-name-global.gif` and `game-name-jp.gif`.
	- Saved to the `game-icons` folder.

#### game-data.js
For readability, all games in this array are sorted alphabetically by name, including any starting with "The".  
If a game has multiple servers in the array, it is then further sorted alphabetically by region/language (`server`).

A game server can be added with the following object template:
```js
{
	game: "GAME_NAME",
	server: "GAME_SERVER_REGION_OR_LANGUAGE",
	timezone: "GAME_SERVER_TIMEZONE",
	dailyReset: "GAME_SERVER_DAILY_RESET_TIME",
	icon: "FILENAME_WITHOUT_FILE_EXTENSION",
	utcDailyReset: "OPTIONAL_SEE_BELOW",
	menuName: "OPTIONAL_SEE_BELOW"
},
```

There are two additional optional properties which can be added:

##### utcDailyReset

`utcDailyReset` is a boolen which decides if the `dailyReset` is interpretated as having `Etc/UTC` as its timezone first, before converting and displaying it to the user as its appropriate `timezone` property.

This only needs to be set to `true` if the game server's reset time changes during the server's daylight savings.  
Example where it is set to `true`: If the reset time is 05:00 during PST, and changed to 06:00 during PDT.

If set to `true`, the `dailyReset` **must** use UTC/GMT.  
`timezone` does not require any specific changes.

For most games this is does not apply, and can be omitted from the object.

##### menuName

`menuName` is a string which allows games to have custom display names in the game filter list.

This can help with readability for game names that are long, and/or have other similarly named games that may conflict.
