# Game Time Master
Sick of memorising time zones to convert for games and their daily reset times?  
Then this is for you!

## Features
- Automatically detects your local time zone.
- Converts all game server times to your local time zone.
- Shows the time remaining until a game server's daily reset.
- Automatically refreshes data every minute.
  - Option to refresh and display every second.
- All calculations take daylight savings into account where applicable.
  - By default, this assumes that servers keep the same times (e.g. 06:00 PST -> 06:00 PDT).  
  If a game doesn't (e.g. 05:00 PST -> 06:00 PDT), then it will be adjusted for that game.
- Choose between 24-hour and 12-hour time formats.
- Search for specific games.
- Filter specific games and save this setting per browser.
- Dark/night mode.

Feel free to request for more games to be added by creating an issue [here](https://github.com/cicerakes/Game-Time-Master/issues).

## Feature Roadmap
- Manually set time zone (for when auto detect is wrong).
- Add custom game servers.
